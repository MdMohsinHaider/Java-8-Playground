# Java 8 Playground

Welcome to the Java 8 Playground!  
This repository is dedicated to practicing, experimenting, and mastering the major features introduced in Java 8.  
Java 8 marked a revolution for Java developers, bringing functional programming paradigms alongside traditional OOP.

## Purpose of Java 8

- Java was originally a pure Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language, and it lacked benefits of functional programming.
- Java 8 was introduced to help developers utilize **functional programming features** (like lambdas and streams) alongside OOP, without changing the language's core.[1]
- It aims to simplify code, enable more expressive constructs, and make Java code efficient on modern multicore processors by supporting parallelism.[2]

## Key Features

- **Lambda Expressions**: Write clear, concise code by passing functionality as methods or arguments.[3][4]
- **Functional Interfaces**: Interfaces with a single abstract method for use with lambdas (e.g., Runnable, Comparator).[5][3]
- **Stream API**: Efficient processing of large data sets via map-reduce, filtering, and parallel operations.[4][3]
- **Default and Static Methods in Interfaces**: Add new methods to interfaces without breaking existing code.[3]
- **New Date & Time API**: More consistent and user-friendly time/date handling.[6][3]
- **Method References**: Concise way to refer to existing methods using ::
- **Optional Class**: Avoid null pointer exceptions with this new container class.

## Why Use Java 8?

- Enables **functional-style programming** in Java for cleaner, maintainable code.
- Simplifies operations on collections and supports **parallel programming** for better use of multicore hardware.
- Keeps all existing OOP strengths and is backward compatible.

## Getting Started

- Explore the `/src` directory for hands-on examples and experiments.
- Refer to each feature folder for code snippets demonstrating real-world application.
